<h1>Where Do Illegal Guns Come From?</h1>

<div style="width:620px">
    <p>Each year approximately 250,000 firearms are reported stolen in the United States.  Based on the ATF Tracing Program, approximately half that number
        are recovered each year, meaning there is an ever-growing stockpile of illegal arms that numbers in the millions.</p>
    <p>Using ATF Tracing Data and a gun rights scoring model created by <i>Guns & Ammo</i> Magazine (<a href="http://www.gunsandammo.com/2013/03/14/ga-ranks-the-best-states-for-gun-owners-in-2013/">Laws for Firearms: Best States for Gun Owners in 2013</a>), we identified a correlation between
        a state's stance toward gun control and the number of illegal guns originating from that state.</p>
    <p><h2>State by State Breakdown</h2></p>
    <p>This map of the US shows each state's scoring, as per the Guns and Ammo Article, and the ATF tracing data as of 2012.  Click on a state to
    display the data.</p>

    <h2>Do More Illegal Guns Originate in 'Pro-Gun' States?</h2>

    <p>
        If all things were equal, the percentage of guns recovered from a state should be roughly proportional to the percent of US population
        that resides in a state.  In reality, that ratio varies from state to state.  We aggregated states based on their G&A scoring to determine
        if pro-gun states contributed more or less of their share to the stock pile of illegal guns.
    </p>
    <p>
        A value of 1 indicates that the percentage of illegal guns originating from those state is equal to the percentage of the US population
        living in those states.  A score greater than 1 indicates the percentage of illegal guns is a greater than the percentage of population
        by a factor of <i>y</i>.  A score less than 1 indicates the percentage of illegal guns is lower than the percentage of population.
    </p>
    <p>
        As this graph indicates, states with a G&A score lower than 39 tend to produce a much smaller percentage of illegal guns in respect to
        their population, while states whose scores are 39 or greater tend to produce a larger percentage of illegal guns.

    <h2>What Does This All Mean?</h2>
    While it does appear that some relationship exists between gun policy and the proliferation of illegal guns, there is not sufficient evidence to make any significant conclusions. There are enough anomalies that indicate the relationship probably involves factors such as population density, crime rate and mean income.
    <br>
    <br>
    However, it is hard to overlook the fact that many of the states identified as the most friendly to legal gun owners are also the largest sources of illegal guns.  Until the flood of stolen guns can be stemmed, stockpile of illegal weapons in the U.S. will only increase.
